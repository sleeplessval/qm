# quickmaths

A small Rust program that can do common math from the command line.

I got VERY tired of opening a calculator or a full Python interpreter to do simple math, so I initially created `quickmaths` in Python to do math from the command line.

As the features I wanted changed, such as variable assignment, interactive mode, and output status and formatting, I decided to rebuild the utility in Rust.
